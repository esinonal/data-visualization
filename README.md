# data-visualization

These folders each contain their own visualizations. ReverseScatterplot can be run with "live-server", BarChart can be run with "npm run start", then "live-server," and the remaining ones can be run with "npm run start" then navigating to the local host webpage it links to.

There are pictures of the visualizations provided in each of the  folders (and a gif for the HopsPlot). These were all created using D3 and javascript, as well as some CSS.
